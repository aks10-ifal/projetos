            <h2>(Hu)go Template Primer</h2>
            <p>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. Itis
an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In
our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a
good static website. If you have used other template systems from different
languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.</p>
